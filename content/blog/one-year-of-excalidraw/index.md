## Let's start with some numbers

It's been a nice and steady growth, given that our only marketing is Twitter, and of course all the love that we are receiving over there. We are reaching around **60K vistis** per month and the grand total of the visits in our first year is well over **500K**!

### Visists

### Scenes

We are storing all the scenes in our backend with [end to end encryption](/end-to-end-encryption/) (which means we don't have access to the actual drawings since they are all encrypted) and the grand total number of the scenes is almost **50K**!

### Commits

We have well over [100 contributors](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/graphs/contributors) to the project and we have almost daily incremental improvments and deployments to production. Everything is updated frequntly and automatically with tools like [Vercel](https://vercel.com/), [Dependabot](https://github.blog/2020-06-01-keep-all-your-packages-up-to-date-with-dependabot/), and others.

## Our basic tech stack

Excalidraw is fully open sourced and we r¸ely on many other open source projects. We couldn't do it without [Rough.js](https://github.com/rough-stuff/rough) of course and our main stack among other things is [React](https://github.com/facebook/react) and [TypeScript](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript). Our full list of [dependencies](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/network/dependencies) is listed on GitHub and we are using Dependabot to keep them all up to date.

## Some of our features

### Collaboration

Collaborating with multiple users was first implemented by [idlewinn](https://github.com/idlewinn) and improved gradually. It's end to end encrypted, so you can be safe that your drawings are not seen by anyone that you don't want to.
[#879](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/879)

### Excalicharts

Copy any two columns data from Excel, Spreadsheet or comma separated values (CSV) from a text file and paste them into Excalidraw. The first implementation was done by [petehunt](https://github.com/petehunt) and the improvements by [lipis](https://github.com/lipis). [#1723](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/1723), [#2495](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/2495)

### Free Draw mode

The free hand draw was added by [kbariotis](https://github.com/kbariotis). [#1570](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/1570)

## Conclusion

Bla bla

If you have any question you can always drop by our [discussion](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/discussions) board and ask whatever you want. Don't be shy, we are all super friendly.

## Get involved

Excalidraw wouldn't be able to become such a product without all the contributors that gave us not only suggestions and reporting bugs, but actual fixes with hunderds of pull requests. Bla bla bla..

## Acknowledgments

All the charts were just pasted as data in Excalidraw. It's one of the [cool hidden features](https://twitter.com/excalidraw/status/1337355475474669569) and we would love you to try it.

_**P.S.** We will update all the numbers on **1st of Jnuary of 2021** to have a complete picture. So you still have the time to influence the results of the December and spread the word, but only if you are supper happy with the product._
