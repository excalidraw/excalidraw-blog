## Let's start with some numbers

It's been a nice and steady growth, given that our only marketing is Twitter, and of course all the love that we are receiving over there. We are reaching around **60K visits** per month and the grand total of the visits in our first year is well over **500K**!

### Visits

### Commits

We have over [100 contributors](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/graphs/contributors) that help us ship almost daily fixes, improvements, and new features right to production. Using tools and services like [Vercel](https://vercel.com/), [Dependabot](https://github.blog/2020-06-01-keep-all-your-packages-up-to-date-with-dependabot/), [Crowdin](https://crowdin.com/project/excalidraw) we can to smooth this process out, or even completely automate it.

## Our basic tech stack

Excalidraw is fully open sourced and we rely on many other open source projects. We couldn't do it without [Rough.js](https://github.com/rough-stuff/rough) of course and our main stack among other things is [React](https://github.com/facebook/react) and [TypeScript](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript). Our full list of [dependencies](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/network/dependencies) is listed on GitHub and we are using Dependabot to keep them all up to date.

## Some of our features

### ü§ù Collaboration

Collaborating with multiple users was [first implemented](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/879) by [idlewinn](https://github.com/idlewinn) and improved gradually. It's end to end encrypted, so you can be safe that your drawings are not seen by anyone that you don't want to.

### üîí Your data is encrypted

The [backend](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw-json) support for storing data was implemted by [lipis](https://github.com/lipis) and the client [support for encrypting](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/642) the data before submiting was done by [vjeux](https://github.com/vjeux). Read more on how we are doing it in [end to end encryption](/end-to-end-encryption/) article.

### üìö Library

The library was [first introduced](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/1787) by [petehunt](https://github.com/petehunt). Later after adding support for saving the library as a file, we eventually have a public directory for libraries. Visit [libraries.excalidraw.com](https://libraries.excalidraw.com) for more.

### üìä Excalicharts

While we aim to keep Excalidraw simple to use, sometimes we hide little easter eggs that you need to find out for yourself (or follow our [Twitter account](https://twitter.com/excalidraw)). For example, you can copy any two column-tabulated data from Excel, Spreadsheets, or comma separated values (CSV) from a text file and paste them into Excalidraw to get a nice graph out of it. The [first implementation](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/1723) was done by [petehunt](https://github.com/petehunt) and the [improvements](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/2495) by [lipis](https://github.com/lipis).

### ‚úçÔ∏è Free Draw mode

The [free hand draw](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/1570) was added by [kbariotis](https://github.com/kbariotis).

### üè≥ Translations

From early on, users were asking for supporting multiple languages. The [final implementation](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/638) of it was done by [vjeux](https://github.com/vjeux) and the automatic integration with our [Crowdin](https://crowdin.com/project/excalidraw) project was done by [lipis](https://github.com/lipis).

### ‚öôÔ∏è Gatsby plugin

A plugin for Gatsby where you can very easily insert Excalidraw links and it will convert it to SVG during build time. We are actually using it in this post for our charts. Implemented by [trevorblades](https://github.com/trevorblades) and you can find it under [@excalidraw/gatsby-embedder-excalidraw](https://github.com/excalidraw/gatsby-embedder-excalidraw).

## Conclusion

Bla bla

If you have any question you can always drop by our [discussion](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/discussions) board and ask whatever you want. Don't be shy, we are all super friendly.

## Get involved

Excalidraw wouldn't be able to become such a product without all the contributors that gave us not only suggestions and reporting bugs, but actual fixes with hunderds of pull requests. Bla bla bla..
