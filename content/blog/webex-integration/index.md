## Excalidraw ❤️ Meetings

Listening to your stories it's amazing what you use Excalidraw for in the wild, from illustrating blog posts, to wireframing, teaching, presenting, to interviewing. One common denominator is collaboration, which has always been a core part of Excalidraw. Often times, text and drawings aren't enough, and for this purpose we're excited to anounce Excalidraw integration for Webex Meetings.

## How to use

For now, to use a specific embedded app such as Excalidraw in your Webex meeting, you will first need to enable it for for your organization (as an administrator) — once that's done, you will be able to use Excalidraw in your meetings going forward.

When you open the Excalidra app for the first time, you will see a blank canvas. You can draw something to prepare beforehand, or you can start collaborating right away by clicking the "Open together" button at the bottom of the screen.

Your data is [end-to-end ecnrypted](/end-to-end-encryption) the same way as you are used to on https://excalidraw.com.

Note that the collaboration room is active only for the duration of the meeting. Each meeting creates its own room.

## More to come

Some features you are used to from https://excalidraw.com such as export to [Excalidraw Plus](https://plus.excalidraw.com) or the recently added image support isn't yet available in Webex Meetings due a few platform limitations that will be resolved over the coming weeks. For similar reasons, some features available on specific operating systems may not work on others (such as exporting to a file, which currently only works on Windows).

As with Excalidraw itself, we will be improving the Webex integration as time goes on, but even now we are confident it can offer a great value when conducting your meetings. Have fun! ❤️
